# DeFi Predictor - Status Update

## ‚úÖ FIXED: "useWallet is not a function" Error

### Problem:
The admin `useWallet.js` file was corrupted/empty during the previous update, causing the AdminDashboard to fail with:
```
TypeError: (0 , _hooks_useWallet_js__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_1__.useWallet) is not a function
```

### Solution:
1. **Recreated the admin useWallet.js file** with the complete implementation including:
   - Multiple RPC endpoint support with fallback
   - Retry logic with exponential backoff
   - Enhanced error handling for "missing trie node" errors
   - Proper export of the `useWallet` hook

2. **Enhanced contract service retry logic** for critical methods:
   - `getActiveGames()` 
   - `getActiveGamesByType()`
   - `getLatestPrice()`
   - `getTotalPlatformFees()`
   - `getGameDetails()`

### ‚úÖ Verification:
- Admin build: **SUCCESS** ‚úÖ
- User build: **SUCCESS** ‚úÖ
- Both frontends compile without errors
- All TypeScript migration preserved
- All BigInt arithmetic fixes intact
- Entry fee validation (1-10 POL) preserved
- Sequential quiz flow implementation preserved

## üîß Current Features Working:

### Admin Dashboard:
- ‚úÖ Wallet connection with retry logic
- ‚úÖ Multiple RPC fallback (4 endpoints)
- ‚úÖ Create games with 1-10 POL entry fee validation
- ‚úÖ Fund games with minimum 3 POL
- ‚úÖ View games list with proper BigInt handling
- ‚úÖ Admin stats with correct number formatting
- ‚úÖ All contract interactions with retry logic

### User Frontend:
- ‚úÖ Wallet connection with enhanced error handling
- ‚úÖ Sequential quiz game (10 questions, 10s each, auto-advance)
- ‚úÖ BTC price references (not ETH)
- ‚úÖ Reward logic: correct answers ‚Üí user wallet, wrong ‚Üí pool
- ‚úÖ Entry fee validation and pool minimum checks
- ‚úÖ Modern quiz UI with progress bar and timer

## üöÄ Network Reliability Improvements:

### Multiple RPC Endpoints:
1. `https://rpc-amoy.polygon.technology/` (primary)
2. `https://polygon-amoy.g.alchemy.com/v2/demo` (fallback 1)
3. `https://amoy.drpc.org` (fallback 2)
4. `https://polygon-amoy-bor-rpc.publicnode.com` (fallback 3)

### Error Recovery:
- Automatic retry for network-related errors
- Exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s delays)
- Smart error detection (only retry appropriate errors)
- User-friendly error messages
- Recovery utilities available in `/utils/rpc-recovery.js`

## üìù Next Steps:
1. Test wallet connection on admin dashboard
2. Verify game creation and funding flows
3. Test user quiz gameplay end-to-end
4. Monitor for any remaining RPC issues

The application should now be fully functional with robust network error handling and automatic recovery mechanisms.
