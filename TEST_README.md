## Usage Examples

### Testing Quiz Functionality
```javascript
// Create quiz game with crypto questions
const cryptoQuestions = quizQuestions.filter(q => q.topic === "Crypto");
const tree = createMerkleTree(cryptoQuestions);
await deFiPredictor.createGame(gameId, 0, tree.getHexRoot(), ...);

// Player answers question
const proof = getMerkleProof(tree, questionId, correctAnswer);
await deFiPredictor.joinQuiz(gameId, proof, questionId, correctAnswer);
```

### Testing Crypto Predictions
```javascript
// Set market price
await mockAggregator.setPrice(200000000000); // $2000

// Player makes prediction
await deFiPredictor.joinCryptoPrediction(gameId, userPrediction);
```

This test suite ensures the DeFi Predictor contract is robust, secure, and ready for production deployment.
