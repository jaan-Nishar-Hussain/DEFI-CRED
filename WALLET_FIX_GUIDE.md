# Wallet Connection Error Fix - "Missing Trie Node"

## Problem Summary
The error "missing trie node ... state ... is not available" occurs when the RPC provider cannot access certain blockchain state data. This is typically caused by:

- RPC node synchronization issues
- Network connectivity problems
- Rate limiting by RPC providers
- Temporary blockchain state inconsistencies

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Multiple RPC Endpoints with Fallback
- Added multiple RPC endpoints in `constants/contract.js`:
  - Primary: `https://rpc-amoy.polygon.technology/`
  - Fallback 1: `https://polygon-amoy.g.alchemy.com/v2/demo`
  - Fallback 2: `https://amoy.drpc.org`
  - Fallback 3: `https://polygon-amoy-bor-rpc.publicnode.com`

### 2. Retry Logic with Exponential Backoff
- Added `retryOperation` function in `useWallet.js`
- Implements 3 retry attempts with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s)
- Applied to all wallet operations that might fail due to network issues

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling
- Specific error messages for different failure types
- Better user feedback for network-related issues
- Graceful degradation when operations fail

### 4. Contract Service Improvements
- Added `retryContractOperation` function in `contract-service.js`
- Automatic retry for contract calls that fail due to network issues
- Smart error detection (only retry network-related errors)

### 5. Recovery Utilities
- Created `utils/rpc-recovery.js` with diagnostic tools:
  - `testRpcEndpoints()` - Test all RPC endpoints
  - `clearLocalStorage()` - Clear wallet connection data
  - `resetWalletConnection()` - Reset MetaMask connection
  - `getDiagnosticInfo()` - Get system diagnostic info

## Testing the Fixes

### 1. Automatic Recovery
The application now automatically:
- Retries failed operations up to 3 times
- Uses exponential backoff to avoid overwhelming the RPC
- Provides better error messages to users

### 2. Manual Recovery Options
If users still encounter issues, they can:

```javascript
// In browser console, run:
import { testRpcEndpoints, resetWalletConnection } from './utils/rpc-recovery.js';

// Test all RPC endpoints
const results = await testRpcEndpoints();
console.log(results);

// Reset wallet connection if needed
await resetWalletConnection();
```

### 3. Alternative Solutions for Users

#### Option 1: Switch MetaMask RPC
1. Open MetaMask
2. Go to Settings > Networks > Polygon Amoy
3. Change RPC URL to one of the working endpoints:
   - `https://polygon-amoy.g.alchemy.com/v2/demo`
   - `https://amoy.drpc.org`
   - `https://polygon-amoy-bor-rpc.publicnode.com`

#### Option 2: Clear Browser Data
1. Clear browser cache and localStorage
2. Disconnect and reconnect MetaMask
3. Try connecting again

#### Option 3: Use Different Browser/Incognito Mode
Sometimes browser extensions or cached data cause issues.

## Technical Details

### Error Types Handled
- `missing trie node` - RPC state unavailability
- `network error` - Connection timeouts
- `User rejected` - User cancelled transaction
- `insufficient funds` - Account balance issues

### Retry Strategy
```javascript
const retryOperation = async (operation, maxRetries = 3, delay = 1000) => {
  for (let i = 0; i < maxRetries; i++) {
    try {
      return await operation();
    } catch (error) {
      if (i === maxRetries - 1) throw error;
      console.warn(`Operation failed, retrying in ${delay}ms...`);
      await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, delay));
      delay *= 2; // Exponential backoff
    }
  }
};
```

### Network Configuration
The application now uses multiple RPC endpoints and automatically falls back to working ones when the primary fails.

## Prevention Tips

1. **Use a reliable RPC provider** - Consider Alchemy, Infura, or other premium providers
2. **Implement proper error handling** - Always wrap RPC calls in try-catch
3. **Use retry logic** - Network operations can be transient
4. **Provide user feedback** - Let users know what's happening
5. **Have fallback options** - Multiple RPC endpoints prevent single points of failure

## Monitoring

To monitor RPC health:
- Check endpoint status regularly
- Monitor error rates in browser console
- Use the diagnostic tools provided
- Consider implementing custom RPC health monitoring

This comprehensive fix addresses the wallet connection issues and provides multiple recovery mechanisms for users experiencing RPC-related problems.
